This code generates a random dataset with 100 data points and performs basic data analysis by calculating the mean, median, maximum, and minimum values of the dataset. It then visualizes the data using Matplotlib by creating a scatter plot of the data points and adding horizontal lines to represent the mean, median, maximum, and minimum values.
## datavis2.ipynb file
The code loads the data using Pandas, performs basic data analysis by calculating the mean, median, maximum, and minimum values of the Value column, and then visualizes the data using Matplotlib. It creates a line plot with markers to represent the data points and adds horizontal lines for the mean, median, maximum, and minimum values. The x-axis represents the dates, and the y-axis represents the values.
