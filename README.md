# data-visualization
This code generates a random dataset with 100 data points and performs basic data analysis by calculating the mean, median, maximum, and minimum values of the dataset. It then visualizes the data using Matplotlib by creating a scatter plot of the data points and adding horizontal lines to represent the mean, median, maximum, and minimum values.
